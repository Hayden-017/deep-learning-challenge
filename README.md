# deep-learning-challenge
Overview: 
  The analysis attempts to develop a deep learning model using neural networks to predict the success of funding applications from Alphabet Soup.
  
Data Processing:
  The target variable for the model is likely to be a binary indicator representing the success or failure of a funding application, labeled as IS_SUCCESSFUL. Features include characteristics of the funding application, such as APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, and other factors. Variables like EIN and NAME may be removed as they are identifiers and might not contribute to the predictions of the model.
  
Summary: 
  The deep learning model showed promising results in predicting the success of funding applications. However, optimization might be possible by exploring different architectures and fine-tuning parameters.
